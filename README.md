# Bachelor’s Thesis: Multi-Agent Architecture Design  
**Workflow Automation in Compliance with Operational Excellence**

This repository contains the source files, artifacts, and documentation for my bachelor’s thesis at DHBW Ravensburg (2025).  
The thesis investigates how multi-agent systems can serve as a conceptual reference architecture for integrating generative AI into enterprise workflow automation.

## AI Assistance Declaration
ChatGPT was used as a writing assistant to help with:  
- Refining English phrasing (not my first language)  
- Redacting, synthesizing, and structuring ideas  
- Improving clarity of communication  

All academic content, analysis, and conclusions are my own.  
The AI usage is documented transparently in line with DHBW requirements (see Notion Notebook and AI-Usage Appendix).
