# Multi-Agent Architecture Design  
**Workflow Automation in Compliance with Operational Excellence**

This repository contains the source files, artifacts, and documentation for my bachelor’s thesis, which investigates how multi-agent systems can serve as a conceptual reference architecture for integrating generative AI into enterprise workflow automation. For a detailed project log, framework notes, and AI usage declaration, see the dedicated [Notion page](https://franrmueller.notion.site/bachelor-thesis-214170088c3680d0b1abf2b6b7b1744a).

## Repository Contents
- [**Thesis PDF (latest version)**](out/bachelor-thesis.pdf)  
- **LaTeX sources** – Main document and chapters  
- **`Makefile`** – Automated build script for compiling LaTeX into PDF  
- **Models** – SysML and other visualizations used in the thesis

## AI-Usage Declaration
ChatGPT was used as a writing assistant to support:  
- Refining English phrasing (not my first language)  
- Redacting, synthesizing, and structuring ideas  
- Improving clarity of communication  
- Supporting literature discovery and summarization to complement my own research  

All academic content, analysis, and conclusions are my own. The AI usage is documented transparently in line with DHBW requirements (see [notion](https://franrmueller.notion.site/bachelor-thesis-214170088c3680d0b1abf2b6b7b1744a) and AI-Usage Appendix).
