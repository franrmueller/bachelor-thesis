[Placeholder, still a work in progress] The literature suggests three design-relevant insights: (1) OpEx increasingly hinges on adaptability, decision quality, and compliance—not only efficiency; (2) automation is moving from deterministic scripts (RPA) to adaptive, tool-using agents; and (3) MAS provide a natural organizing structure for such agents in complex enterprises but necessitate robust governance, monitoring, and integration. These insights inform the requirements (e.g., traceability, policy constraints, observability) and the architecture choices (agent roles, interaction patterns, orchestration) developed later in this thesis.
