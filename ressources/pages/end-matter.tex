\subsection*{\thesection.\arabic{subsection}: Requirements List}\label{app:req-list}
\noindent \textsc{functional requirements} \\
\begin{footnotesize}
\noindent \textsc{FR-01 process orchestration engine} --- The system shall execute workflow models by dispatching tasks to human or software actors according to model control flow and business rules. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-02 parameterized subprocesses} --- The system shall support parameterized subprocesses and rules so behavioral variants can be expressed without altering the underlying process structure. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-03 human-machine task orchestration} --- The system shall coordinate both human and automated tasks within the same orchestrated process model. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-04 exception detection and routing} --- The system shall detect deviations from the nominal process and route cases to defined exception subprocesses. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-05 escalation to human authority} --- The system shall escalate unresolved or unmodeled exceptions to designated human roles with clear ownership. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-06 inter-agent communication protocol} --- The system shall specify message formats and interaction rules for agent collaboration (e.g., direct messaging or shared memory; event-bus/blackboard where asynchronous exchange is required).\\
\noindent \textsc{FR-07 tool failure handling in exceptions} --- The system shall validate tool/API outputs and trigger defined recovery or fallback steps when invocations fail.\\
\noindent \textsc{FR-08 conflict resolution} --- The system shall provide mechanisms for agents to resolve task or decision conflicts (e.g., delegation to a planner, negotiation, or voting).\\
\noindent \textsc{FR-09 policy engine} --- The system shall provide a decoupled policy evaluation component that can validate, veto, or redirect workflow executions and agent actions at runtime. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-10 risk-based approvals and escalation} --- The system shall require human approval and/or escalation for actions or decisions exceeding defined risk or impact thresholds. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-11 compliance mapping and drift checks} --- The system shall map actions and policies to applicable regulations or internal rules and perform runtime checks to detect and block compliance drift. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-12 evidence-based decision support} --- The system shall aggregate relevant data at decision points to support evidence-based choices and reduce errors. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-13 rule-enforced decision points} --- The system shall enforce business rules and role responsibilities at decision points to ensure consistent, auditable outcomes. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-14 decision trace and rationale} --- The system shall persist a human-readable decision trace for automated or assisted decisions, including inputs, tool/API calls and results, and concise rationale summaries. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-15 event logging pipeline} --- The system shall instrument the workflow engine and agents to emit structured, timestamped events for key actions (e.g., prompts, tool/API invocations and results, plan/decision commits, and state changes). \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-16 dashboards and alerts} --- The system shall provide real-time dashboards and alerting for observability metrics (e.g., execution latency, error/anomaly rates, blocked actions). \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-17 replay for post-hoc analysis} --- The system shall support reconstruction and replay of workflow and agent interactions from logged events to enable root-cause analysis and explanation of outcomes. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-18 integration connectors} --- The system shall provide connectors to integrate heterogeneous applications and data sources required by the workflows. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-19 agent tool adapters} --- The system shall expose a uniform adapter interface for agents and workflows to invoke external tools, APIs, databases, or RPA scripts. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-20 inter-organizational interoperability} --- The system shall support protocol and interface interoperability suitable for cross-organizational workflows. \\
\noindent \textsc{FR-21 data transformation layer} --- The system shall provide mapping and transformation capabilities to reconcile data across integrated systems. \\
\end{footnotesize}

\noindent \textsc{constraints} \\
\begin{footnotesize}
\noindent \textsc{C-01 segregation of duties} --- The system shall enforce role-based access control and segregation of duties for configuration changes and sensitive actions. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-02 audit logging and retention} --- The system shall produce tamper-evident audit trails of agent actions, policy decisions, and configuration changes, retained according to the applicable compliance policy. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-03 bounded decision autonomy} --- The system shall constrain agent decision-making to clearly scoped authority levels aligned with organizational objectives. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-04 modular process units} --- The system shall structure workflows as modular subprocesses or services that can be reused and reconfigured without redesign. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-05 interface-based composition} --- The system shall expose clear process and service interfaces compatible with established interoperability standards to enable composition across heterogeneous systems and organizations. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-06 explicit coordination model} --- The system shall define and enforce a coordination structure (e.g., hierarchical plannerâ€“specialists or decentralized collaboration) for multi-agent work. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-07 agent status self-reporting} --- The system shall require agents to periodically self-report status and progress (e.g., current task, step outcome, next planned action) to improve runtime transparency. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-08 interface contracts and schemas} --- The system shall define input/output contracts and validate request/response schemas at adapter boundaries. \\
\noindent \textsc{C-09 invocation safeguards} --- The system shall enforce adapter-level safeguards (e.g., timeouts, retries, and idempotency keys) to limit side effects of failed or repeated tool calls.
